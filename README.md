# Interactive interface for bike shop(prototype)

My name is Stanislav Mostovych  and i like hiking  and ride mountain bike. I have many years experience to do that. When i studied at University i created some innovation project to help companies and customers. Because many times people asked me can you help me buy a bike, also when people don't have any experience how choose best product for self, they buy product and dont have satisfaction. I started thinking how i can help them.
I created simple and usability interface. This interface can help people choose best productfor their preferenceses, and they spent less time to do that.


On image below we can see home page and first step to help customers choose product.
When customer click on “Choose bike for self” will be open another step.

Next step show where do  you prefer  ride by bike. This step will be segregate bikes by preferences. If customer choose freeride will be show bikes for freeride. When customer choose preference, will be open next step.

Last step will be represent entering physical parameters customers. Customer choose gender and how many times will be ride, also input weight and height. This last step need to filtr bikes with frame and another parameters, whose need to show best product for customer. When customer inputted data and clicked button “Next ” will be showed list best product for customer.

I think this interactive and simple interface can help customers buy QUICKLY. The next one people don't want spend time to read many information, they search another way to buy product. I think this small project can help REI to be better on internet market and customers will have positive impression of the bought product. This model can be used for another products for example ski.
